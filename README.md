Learning GitHub tutorial on Repositories

I'm interested in learning how to code after doing minor changes to my wordpress blog. I hope for a better understanding on the logic behind it all. 

I hear Python is a great place to start. So I'm learning Python through Flatiron School. After that, I want to try Ruby and Javascript. 

Currently working on becoming a Software Engineer. With more extensive learning and practice, I want to propel myself into Data Science and AI. It's ambitious but I have to try.
